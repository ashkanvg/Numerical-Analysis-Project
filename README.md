# Fixed Point Theorem Checker and Sequence Calculator

This program is designed to check the conditions of the fixed point theorem for a given function and, if the conditions are met, calculate the sequence using the fixed point method.

## Features

- **Condition Check**: Verifies the conditions of the fixed point theorem for the input function.
- **Sequence Calculation**: Computes the sequence of the fixed point method if the conditions are satisfied.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `sympy`

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy sympy
```
